Hi, I'm Nick Janes! A dedicated back end developer with a passion for building unique solutions with technology. I've built tons of fun projects across a plethora of domains such as web dev, game dev, computer networking, AI and more. I was a previous intern as a full stack engineer for a company named Odoo, where I built applications for an open source ERP system.

I thrive on curiosity and am always seeking to satiate it through learning and building.

I would love it if you would reach out to me, even if just to say hello:

I respond uber quick on discord to nickj98.
